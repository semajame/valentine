        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                From the day that I talked you
                <br>
                You have been in my heart.
                <br>
                You may not be with me
                <br>
                But I can never be apart.
                <br>
                <br>
                You have no idea
                <br>
                How important you are to me.
                <br>
                But I confess, cause
                <br>
                Losing you was something I couldn’t see.
                <br>
                <br>
                I thought I would never be able to say
                <br>
                Those three eternal words to someone.
                <br>
                But if I don’t say this now
                <br>
                I might never be able to get them through.
                <br>
                <br>
                I didn’t even know a few years back
                <br>
                Why this day was celebrated,
                <br>
                But now I feel that this is the day
                <br>
                For which I had waited.
                <br>
                <br>
                I want to give you enough happiness
                <br>
                To fill your entire life. 
                <br>
                If you just tell me once,
                <br>
                I’ll even go through a knife.
                <br>
                <br>
                For now and forever,
                <br>
                I want to make you mine.
                <br>
                Oh my sweet love,
                <span>
                Will you be my valentine?
                </span>

            Always remember that I will love you til the end of time. I may not be the richest guy, but I will do my best to give you the world. You are the best that has ever happened to me. I hope to marry you someday.
